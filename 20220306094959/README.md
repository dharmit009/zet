# Anonymous Functions:

**Anonymous functions** also known as **Lambda functions** in python are
pretty powerful as you can declare an entire function in a single
line though it does reduce the readability of the code.

* **Syntax for lambda functions:**

```python

# <variableName> = lambda <input1> <input..n> : <return val1>, <return val2>
# To call the anonymous function we use the following ...
# variableName(parameter1, parameter..n)
a = lambda x: x*2
print(a(2))

```
* **Output:**

# Maybe I switched back to qwerty today !!

## Dvorak

Dvorak is great I really like the way it minimizes the amount of movement of your hands I may even switch to it someday if i get enough time. Here is a crazy thing I writing this Zettel with qwerty and my wrist has started to pain already this ouch !! I think I need to stay on Dvorak ...

I think I need to divide this into pros and cons for now:

**Pros to switching to Dvorak:**

1. Better movement.
1. Less wrist pain.

**Cons to switching to Dvorak:**

1. Loose VIM keys.
1. Relearn the keyboard layout.
1. No Intuitive keyboard shortcuts.
1. Adds quite a lot of work and time plus can't work on many things till that time.


## Qwerty:

**Pros for staying on Qwerty:**

1. Familiar layout.
1. Can work on other things.

**Cons for staying on Qwerty:**

1. Long term will affect more.
1. Hurts my wrist !!

QWERTY hurts a bit but I can always upgrade my accessories and make things better.

One of the things I need start doing is taking breaks in betweens for now I will continue with qwerty and if my hand hurts a bit more then I will change to Dvorak.

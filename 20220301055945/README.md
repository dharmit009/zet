# Stop using `echo` start using `printf` POSIX

I have been made aware that `echo` is not **POSIX COMPLIANT**. It is
recommended to use `printf` instead. You can use `echo` as **POSIX** if
you do not use `-n` and `-e` switches. 

At this point I would rather use `printf` as it offers me more 
such as C-Style formatting which I like to use that a lot.

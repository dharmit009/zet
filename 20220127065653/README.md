# Are Crypto's a Scam?

> I need to collect some thought on it... still gathering some thoughts ...

`Folded cases` pointed out that Bitcoin has been flawed by design, the fact that it uses a ton of energy while being inefficient when compared to banks. 

When I come to think it ... **It True Bitcoin has not helped people which it was suppose to do instead it was or it is being misused in all sorts of different things some of you may not agree with me but it has infact it has provided a medium for hackers, scammers, drug dealers, even money launders to make things available worldwide. And if you don't agree fine then just tell me why is they promote adult industries? (specially tron) they even used it for marketing. Now come to think of it why isn't fighting against that?, If crypto is suppose to help world a better place why not help those people. Another thing is that half of the people who are actually poor don't have smartphones, leave that they don't even have food and people here talk about internet and smartphone.**

This may sound a little too harsh but it's the truth. Alright let me explain right now I have around (X) amount of BTC. I know that not a lot in country maybe but in my country you can probably have food for one entire day from the street. Now let say I want to give them to a beggar not NGO's it's my Money right? I have the control right? BUT THE BEGGAR DOES NOT HAVE FOOD LET ALONE A SMARTPHONE WITH A CRYPTO WALLET. 

One of the best things that `Folded Cases` video expressed was how blockchains where used to store medical data and I Quote:

> The idea of putting medical records on public, decentrailzed, trustless blockchain is absolutely nightmarish and anyone who proposes it should be instantly discredited. 

I must say I completely agree with that because I took both doses of vaccine & It absolutely scares the shit out of me that my country uses blockchain to store that information because I don't what kind of data they have stored, yeah I can look for it but where should I look for it and even if I knew there are people out there who don't know how to use a touch screen phone. So it make me think (not scared) what are they trying to achieve.

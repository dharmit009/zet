# Git and dotfiles ...

It is one of the most impressive tools for development purposes but the
interface is so ugly that it scares the beginners away from it. One of
the key problem is that beginners tend to focus more on usability rather
than the ideology of the software meaning they just try to use the
service rather than understanding the basic architecture of the git and
how it works once that is covered it becomes easier to use. 

One of the most frustrating things I have found is how to take backups
of dotfiles and manage them. This has been a lot confusing for me as
everyone tends have their own way of doing it. 

For Example: 
* *rwxrob:* uses symlinks to take backups with help of git. 
* *ThePrimeegan:* uses stow a GNU program to manage dotfiles. (I have
	found this method a little confusing for me personally). 
* *Distrotube:* Not the best person to ask but he tends use bare
	repository which is hell a lot confusing as I barely managed to learn
	some basics of git. 

Guess I need to find my own way.

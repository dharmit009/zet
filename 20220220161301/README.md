# Pentesting Distributions Require More Updates: 

One of the key things I have noticed after installing Black Arch
Repository on Manjaro is that it require updates more frequently.
According to my deduction that is because of the field of Cybersecurity
as it is ever changing there seems to be an update each and every other
day. I might be wrong about it but seems to me that pentesting
distributions require more regular updates when compared to normal
distributions.

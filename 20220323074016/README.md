# Use Vim Only If Needed ...

**Vim** is one of the most popular text-editors in **The World of
Unix.** But it's not for everything. Many people have this misconception
that if you are using Linux/Unix you should be only be `vim` as your
text-editor which is completely wrong. It is one of the essential skill
as Linux user to learn a CLI based text editor if you are working in
terminal all the time.

One of areas where I find `vim` lacks behind is as compared to an IDE.
If you are working on particularly on one programming language it is
best that you go and use an IDE as they will much more efficient as
compared to `vim`. Example: **Netbeans**

I had to use **Netbeans** for my college assignments. I hated using it
so I tried converting my `vim` into a **Netbeans** like IDE. ðŸ˜† What a
terrible Idea!! Right? ... As I was configuring I realize it is better
to just use **Netbeans** for this stuff as configuring `vim` is such a
manner was a waste of time and exact opposite of **Unix Philosophy**.

**TLDR:** Use **VIM** but not for everything. Some tools are simply just better
for the job.

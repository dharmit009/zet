# Bash Env variables ...

**Bash** environment variables are just awesome. The EXPORTED env variables can directly be used within scripts. There is no need to import the variable, No need to provide any reference, & No Declaration is needed.

Here is a small example: 

```bash test.sh 
echo "$EDITOR"

```
> vim

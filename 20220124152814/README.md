# The Feeling Of Getting STUCK !!

I have always started a number of courses, tutorials, and things but there is one thing in common and that is I always feel like I got STUCK in it ... whenever that happens I start to lose interest most of the time it results me into dropping that hole idea. Which actually makes things worse because then I have to find something to learn again rather than sticking to what I should be doing. 

The first thing that one should learn is how to be `consistent`. Progress always come a little late then you expect sometimes very late but brings the reward for sure. Whether this is coding, programming, or anything else. Also know when you should give something up like you don't need to know each and every keyword about a programming language you might forget a few that fine. 
If you don't understand that one particular topic skip it for now try some other time, look for help online/offline, ask in communities, there is so much we can do this days and if you still feel stuck look it in a different way. Try breaking it up into pieces. That's all

> Learn how to be consistent? and it's not to know somethings !!
